# comp2140_forms-app

This is the main repo for the FormBase app

Just like with the React Web assignment, the code is split into multiple node projects, in this case two. The folder `forms-app` contains the code for the React Native app itself, while the folder `api-tool` contains code for the CLI backend tool I used for testing.

The majority of this project has been written **without** the aid of generative AI (because I'm old school!).

The devices I have tested on are:
- Samsung Galaxy A22 (Android 13)
- Android Emulator (Android 16)
